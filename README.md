## 🛠️ Tech Stack

```
MindAR.js (v1.2.5)   →  Image-target AR tracking
A-Frame (v1.4.2)      →  3D/AR scene rendering  
Vanilla JS            →  App logic, UI, page navigation
CSS Custom Properties →  Theming & responsive layout
GitHub Pages          →  Zero-cost static hosting
```

**No React. No Node. No backend. No app store.** Just a single HTML file deployed statically.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjai1202-we/Roadmap-Ar.git
cd Roadmap-Ar

# Serve with any static server (HTTPS required for camera access)
npx serve .
# or
python -m http.server 8080
```

> ⚠️ **HTTPS is mandatory** for camera/WebXR APIs. Use `localhost` or deploy to HTTPS.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push repo to GitHub
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source: main branch / root**
3. Visit `https://your-username.github.io/Roadmap-Ar/`

## 🏗️ Architecture & Key Decisions

### Why a Single HTML File?
- **Zero deployment complexity** — works on any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- **No build step** — iterate and ship instantly
- **Offline-capable** — assets cached by browser after first load

### AR Pipeline
```
Camera feed (getUserMedia)
    ↓
MindAR image tracker (WASM-powered neural net)
    ↓
Target match → A-Frame entity show/hide
    ↓
Overlay video anchored to physical marker
    ↓
User taps "OPEN VIDEO" → full-screen custom player
```

### UI Architecture — 3-Page SPA
| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| **Home** | College branding, department pills, CTA |
| **Scanner** | Live AR camera view with target detection |
| **Video Player** | Full-screen playback with custom controls |

Page transitions use CSS `opacity` + `transform` with no framework overhead.
